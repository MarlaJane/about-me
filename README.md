# about-me
My name is Marla, or you can call me Marla Jane. I recently suffered a brain injury and have had to change my lifestyle in order to work with my "new normal." 


Fun Facts: I already think I messed this up because I created a branch in answer-one instead of going back into the master branch. So, I am trying again.
Also, I am a vegan and my favorite color is glitter.
